The dataset has recently been used in the context of the [GeoLingIt shared task](https://github.com/dhfbk/geolingit-evalita2023) at [EVALITA 2023](https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/).


## Data

The corpus is released in the form of tweet IDs to be hydrated, in compliance to the Twitter developer policy. Data is in the `data/` folder and includes three files:

- `train.txt`: the training set, totalling 13,669 posts;
- `dev.txt`: the development set, totalling 552 posts;
- `test.txt`: the test set, totalling 818 posts.

The text of the post can be rehydrated from the [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) of the Twitter json response. Just iterate over the posts (i.e., `for post in json_object["data"]`) and get the `post["text"]` content.

The location labels can be rehydrated from the [Place object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/place) of the Twitter json response. Just iterate over the places for the posts (i.e., `for place in json_object["includes"]["places"]`) and get the relevant information:
- **region**: `place["name"].split(", ")[1]`;
- **latitude**: `from_bbox_to_point(place["geo"]["bbox"])[0]`;
- **longitude**: `from_bbox_to_point(place["geo"]["bbox"])[1]`.

The `from_bbox_to_point()` function computes latitude and longitude coordinates by
taking the central point from the 4-point bounding box of city areas given by the Twitter APIs. It is defined as follows:

```python
def from_bbox_to_point(bbox):
    w_long, s_lat, e_long, n_lat = bbox
    latitude = (s_lat + n_lat) / 2
    longitude = (w_long + e_long) / 2
    return [latitude, longitude]
```
